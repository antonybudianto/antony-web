Here are my top favorite free hosting providers I've personally used:

## Google Cloud Platform

You can create one free VM ([Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/)) with full server access, and... it's [always free](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#always-free)!

#### Pro:

- Full server access and customization
- Cloud SSH
- Always free
- Generous resource limit
- Free custom domain

#### Cons:

- Setup your own web server
- Setup your own HTTPS/SSL and renewal
- Manual deployment

It's a good platform to learn how to setup a fullstack by your own.

## Netlify

I just recently tried [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and I loved it. You can connect your repository and provide build command, then you just need to push commit to deploy. You can also connect your domain with its free DNS service and you'll get free HTTPS/SSL provision and auto-renewal. You can also deploy function with NodeJS or Go.

#### Pro:

- Fully automated deployment
- Free custom domain
- Free DNS management
- Support FaaS (NodeJS, Go)
- Free HTTPS/SSL provision and renewal
- Ease of setup (only need a repo)

#### Cons:

- No server access

## Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a product by Google that provides many cloud services like Realtime DB, Auth, Storage, Hosting, and more. You can host your website and connect your domain for free. Deployment is done using Firebase CLI.

#### Pro:

- Many integrated free cloud products
- Free custom domain
- Support FaaS (NodeJS)
- Deployment log and rollback
- Free HTTPS/SSL provision and renewal

#### Cons:

- No server access
- Need to setup Firebase CLI
